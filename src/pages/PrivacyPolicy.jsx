        When you visit this website, the provider automatically collects and
        stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visited page</li>
        <li>Time of access</li>
        <li>Amount of data sent in bytes</li>

        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The collected data is used only for statistical analysis and to improve
        the website. However, the website operator reserves the right to check
        the server log files retrospectively if there is concrete evidence of
        illegal use.

        Personal data includes all information that can be used to identify you

        You have the right to request, free of charge, information about the
        personal data stored about you. You also have the right to correct
